78,41170,19382,35622,6,21,12,awning,gramophone,truck,1,1,"1. First, let us analyze the main characteristics of each object:
   - Truck: A vehicle used for transportation of goods and materials.
   - Gramophone: A device used for playing music through records.
   - Awning: A structure used as a roof-like shelter, usually outdoors.

2. We can observe their primary similarities and differences:
   - Trucks and gramophones are both mechanical in nature, while an awning primarily serves a protective purpose.
   - Trucks and awnings can be found outdoors, while gramophones are generally used indoors.
   - Gramophones and awnings are non-motorized items, while a truck is motorized.

3. Determine the least similar object by comparing the differences:
   - Trucks and gramophones share the similarity of being mechanical, with the key difference being their specific function.
   - Trucks and awnings share an outdoor aspect, with the key difference being the function: one for transport, and one for shelter.
   - Gramophones and awnings differ more significantly in both function and setting. The gramophone serves to play music and is typically used indoors, whereas the awning is designed to provide shelter outdoors.

Based on the comparison, a gramophone's indoor usage and primary purpose for playing music make it more different from a truck than an awning is from either a truck or a gramophone. The answer is 2."
